## Design for Everyone

Our award eco-system has millions of users with diverse roles and needs. We have, therefore, designed the SAM.gov design system recognizing that people will use it in ways that we haven't anticipated or explored.

This doesn't mean that we never consider specific users. We have designed some experiences in our eco-system around specific edge-case users.  For example, we designed our role management capabilities considering, in particular, the needs of people who manage the largest organizations. However, given the size and scope of our customers and stakeholders, we approach design with the understanding that we must consider "everyone."
